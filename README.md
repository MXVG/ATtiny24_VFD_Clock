# ATtiny24_VFD_Clock
IV-18 VFD Clock using ATtiny24

A simple clock driven by an ATtiny24 and a MAX6921 shift register. 
The tube is using 5V from a voltage regulator for the filament and ~50V from an open loop boost converter for the digits and segments.
An external 16Mhz ceramic oscillator was used as a slightly more accurate solution to keeping track of the time
